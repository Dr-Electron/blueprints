<!--

## Prerequisites

To deploy the P2P energy grid app, you must have the following:

### Hardware

- The sources, producers, and consumers can run on Raspberry Pis (RPi)
- The grid must be run on a server that's capable of web APIs, database storage and background tasks

### Software

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

- [MAM (Masked Authenticated Messaging)](https://github.com/iotaledger/mam.client.js)

Choose from one of the following cloud services or a local server:

- Amazon
    - [Web server](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
    - [API server](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
    - [NoSQL database](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
    - [Background tasks](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

- Local server
    * Storage: local file system
    * Web server: Nginx
    * API server: Node.js with Express
    * NoSQL database: MongoDB
    * Background tasks: Task scheduler running Node.js tasks

### Programming knowledge

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- [React framework](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Required third-party licenses
- Cloud services

### IOTA knowledge

An understanding of MAM channels.

## Deploy the P2P energy grid app

The deployment instructions are documented in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/poc-p2p-energy).

Sources running on RPi need the following:
- Local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN) connection to the grid
- Connection to a node (can be internal)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/audstanley/NodeJs-Raspberry-Pi)

Producers running on RPi need the following:
- Local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN) connection to the grid
- Connection to a node (can be internal)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/audstanley/NodeJs-Raspberry-Pi)

Consumers running on RPi need the following:
- Local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN) connection to the grid
- Connection to a node (can be internal)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/audstanley/NodeJs-Raspberry-Pi)

Grids running in the cloud or on a local server need the following:
- WAN connection
- Connection to a node
